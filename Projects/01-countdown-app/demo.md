## Project Information

Title

File Renamer



Project Overview

Our team proposes to develop a Python script that will allow users to rename multiple files in a directory using a specified naming convention. The script will enable users to quickly and easily rename files based on a variety of criteria, such as file type, creation date, or custom keywords.

Project Goals:

- Develop a Python script that allows users to batch rename files in a directory
- Implement a user-friendly interface that enables users to specify renaming criteria
- Create a robust and flexible script that can handle a variety of file types and naming conventions
- Ensure the script is efficient and fast, even when processing large numbers of files

Project Scope:

- Develop a Python script using Python 3 and the os and argparse modules
- Enable users to specify renaming criteria such as file type, creation date, or custom keywords
- Allow users to preview the renamed files before making any changes
- Provide documentation and user guides to assist users in using the script

Project Timeline:

- Week 1-2: Project planning and scoping
- Week 3-4: Script development and testing
- Week 5-6: User interface design and implementation
- Week 7-8: Testing and optimization
- Week 9-10: Documentation and user guide creation
- Week 11-12: Final testing and launch

Project Budget:

- Development and testing: $5,000
- User interface design and implementation: $2,000
- Documentation and user guide creation: $1,000

Total project cost: $8,000
